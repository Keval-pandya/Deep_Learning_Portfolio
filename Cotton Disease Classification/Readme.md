# Cotton Disease Classfication using Deep Learning.

## Introduction
Cotton is one of the economically significant agricultural products in the World, but it is exposed to different constraints in the leaf area. Mostly, these constraints are identified as diseases and pests that are hard to detect with the bare eye. These diseases need to be identified as early as possible to avoid production loss.
In this project, We have used the Deep Learning approach to identify the Cotton Disease using the images. 
Here we are using CNN(Convolution Neural Network) to extract the features to make predictions on the cotton Diseases.
Since, We have low ammount of the dataset here i am also using the concept of the transfer learning to use pre-trained model to achive the higher accuracy and low loss.
